# termite-sim

Termite simulation based on Rich Hickey's Ants demo.
Shows of Clojure's STM, agents and refs.

It implements a well know algorithm in Complex Systems research.
The termites randomly walk around, pick up woodchips and drop them next to others.

It is described here, http://www.toyproblems.org/probs/crr/
